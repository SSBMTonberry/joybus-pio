# joybus-pio
GameCube/Nintendo 64 comms library using the RP2040's PIO

## Changes done in this fork
- Added the `fake-pico.hpp` library to fake Pico headers for non-`ARM` compilers. Integrated it into all `header` files of `joybus-pio`. (PR: [#4](https://github.com/SSBMTonberry/joybus-pio/pull/4))
- Added a `Catch2` test project using `GCC` (not `ARM`) (PR: [#4](https://github.com/SSBMTonberry/joybus-pio/pull/4))
- Added a default constructor and `Initialize()` function for `GamecubeConsole`, `GamecubeController`, `N64Console` and `N64Controller`. (PR: [#4](https://github.com/SSBMTonberry/joybus-pio/pull/4))
- Updated all examples to use default constructors and `Initialize()`. (PR: [#4](https://github.com/SSBMTonberry/joybus-pio/pull/4))
- Created a proper `CMakeLists` structure with `joybus_pio` as a standalone library. Build any project inside `examples` to include it. (Issue: [#1](https://github.com/SSBMTonberry/joybus-pio/issues/1), PR: [#2](https://github.com/SSBMTonberry/joybus-pio/pull/2))

## Usage

This library is designed and tested to work with system clock set to 130MHz for the PIO clock divider to be correct.

You can add this library in `lib_deps` if using PlatformIO (tested with arduino-pico core) or add as a git submodule if using Pico SDK.

Autogenerated API documentation can be found [here](https://jonnyhaystack.github.io/joybus-pio/)

Code examples for usage of each API can be found [here](examples/)
